# @bongsu/schema

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 057bff6: The ntfy topic is a setting of each workspace: the dashboard's **Settings → Notifications (ntfy)** sets, tests and
  removes it, and only that workspace's notifications go there. It's stored encrypted (it needs `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) and
  the page shows only its server. Bongsu posts to it without following redirects and with a time limit.
  
  To update: `NOTIFY_URL` is gone. If you used it, paste the same topic in the dashboard's Settings (migration `0016`
  adds the column) and remove the variable or secret.
- de54272: Media stores are set up in the dashboard (**Media**), and there can be several side by side.
  
  - **S3-compatible buckets**: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO. Instagram fetches the files from the bucket
    through presigned links and the app uploads straight to it ([S3-compatible buckets](site/docs/s3.md)).
  - **Connect Google Drive** with your Google app (the one YouTube uses): no service account any more
    ([Google Drive](site/docs/drive.md)).
  - One store of each kind, one of them the default; each file is read from the store it's in, the inbox is read in
    every store, and the app's upload page lets you pick the store. A weekly check marks a store that stopped answering.
  - Get started has a fifth step for it; the app's Settings and `/health` list the stores.
  
  To update: the `MEDIA_STORE`, `DRIVE_SA_JSON` and `DRIVE_OWNER_OAUTH` variables are gone. Set the store up again on the
  dashboard's Media page (Drive with **Connect Google Drive**; on Docker, **This server's disk** for the `local` store),
  and remove those secrets. Migration `0017` adds the `media_store` table. Signed media links now name their store
  (`/m/<store>/<id>`), so links made before the update stop working; they only last a few hours.

### Minor Changes

- 839cc12: Each account's page. The inbox run samples every account's follower (subscriber) count once a day into a new
  `account_metrics` series (migration 0013); an instance with imported nightly snapshots gets their history once. An
  account's page in the app (Stats → an account) charts its followers (Total | Daily) and its posts' views per day over
  7, 30 or 90 days, and ranks the posts and videos that brought followers. The Stats page reads followers from the
  series. The Stats and reviews routes now show only the caller's workspace's snapshots and reviews (they showed every
  workspace's).
- 839cc12: Stats for agents. Three read tools, MCP and REST at once: `get_metrics` (a post's or video's series with its 24 h
  numbers), `get_account_metrics` (an account's followers and views per day) and `list_performance` (the posts and videos
  of a window, ranked by any count). `ingest_metrics` (`POST /v1/metrics`) uploads samples collected elsewhere into the
  same series, behind a new `metrics` scope: opt-in on an agent key, part of the owner's and admin's rights. The CLI gains
  `bongsu stats` and `bongsu ingest`. Migration 0014 drops the unused `labels` and `manual_stats` tables: an instance that
  imported data from an earlier deployment loses what they held, so take a backup first if you want it.
- 839cc12: Moving an instance between databases: `node server.mjs export <file>` writes every table to neutral JSON, `import
  <file>` loads it into a fresh SQLite or Postgres database (all or nothing, same schema version only), and `load-sql
  <dump>` turns a `wrangler d1 export` into a SQLite file to export from. Walkthroughs for SQLite → Postgres and D1 →
  Postgres in docs/databases.md.
- 839cc12: The followers a post or video brought. The metrics series gains Instagram's `follows` and `profile_visits`
  (migration 0012; NULL for samples taken before and for media types without them) and, for YouTube, the subscribers a
  video gained through the YouTube Analytics API. The connect flow now asks for the `yt-analytics.readonly` scope:
  add it to your Google app's consent screen and enable the YouTube Analytics API, then **Reconnect** each channel
  from the dashboard; until then a video's Results view says the subscriber numbers aren't available. The 24 h
  notification and the Results view show "+12 followers · 85 profile visits" (a Trial Reel copy its own), and the
  metric picker gains Followers and Profile visits (Subscribers for a video).
- 839cc12: Results over time: the inbox cron samples each published Instagram post (and its Trial Reel copy) and each public
  YouTube upload into a new `post_metrics` series, every 6 hours for 3 days, daily to day 30, weekly to day 90, a few
  per run (YouTube through `videos.list`, 1 quota unit per channel per run). A published item's page splits into
  **Results | Post** (a YouTube video's into **Results | Video**): the 24 h numbers, now the sample nearest 24 hours
  after publishing, and a line chart, Total or Daily, of views, reach, likes, comments, saves or shares, with the Trial
  Reel as a second line. The 24 h notification's **Open results** opens it. New routes `GET /app-api/item/metrics` and
  `GET /app-api/video/metrics`.
  
  Needs migration 0011, which adds `post_metrics` and drops the six count columns from `post_results`, keeping only the
  median and the marker that the 24 h notification went out. Each earlier 24 h result becomes that post's first sample
  (taken when it was fetched), so posts keep their numbers through the upgrade.
- 839cc12: The database schema is written once (`packages/schema`) and generated per database: `migrations/sqlite/` (the existing
  0001–0009, unchanged, so current databases need nothing) and `migrations/postgres/`, plus `docs/schema.md` and
  `schema.json`. Wrangler, the Node runner and the image now read `migrations/sqlite/`.
- 0af344f: The Stats tab reads only what Bongsu collects or receives: each account's followers from the account series, then the last 7 days' posts and videos, most viewed first, each opening its Results or video page. The snapshot Performance page and the review pages are gone with their routes (`/app-api/performance`, `/app-api/report`), and migration 0015 drops the `reports` table (export it first if an instance imported reviews). The `snapshots` table stays: it backfills the account series once.

### Patch Changes

- 839cc12: Postgres: on Node and Docker, `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…` runs Bongsu on Postgres (the compose file's `postgres`
  profile starts one); the tables come from `migrations/postgres/`, seed rows included. The app's SQL now works on both:
  the database-specific bits live in `core/sql.ts`, and the queries Postgres rejected (untyped `IS NULL` parameters,
  ambiguous names in upserts, the reserved `window`) are fixed.
